    <h2>What Is A Lasagna?</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna, also known as lasagne, is a type of pasta, possibly one of the
      oldest types, made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish
      is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as
      ragù, béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses, and seasonings and spices.

    <h3>Steps to Make Lasagna:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</h4>
        Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the lasagna noodles according
        to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h4>
        In a large skillet, sauté chopped onion and minced garlic until
        softened. Add ground beef and cook until browned. Stir in tomato sauce,
        tomato paste, diced tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and
        pepper. Simmer for 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Make the Cheese Mixture:</h4>
        In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, half of the shredded mozzarella,
        grated Parmesan, and the egg. Mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Assemble the Lasagna:</h4>
        Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a
        thin layer of the meat sauce. Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top.
        Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Add a layer of
        meat sauce on top of the cheese. Repeat the layers (noodles, cheese,
        meat sauce) until you reach the top, finishing with a layer of meat
        sauce. Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella on top.
      </li>

        <h4>Bake:</h4>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove
