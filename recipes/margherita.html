    <h2>What Is Margherita Pizza?</h2>
    <p>
      Margherita Pizza is a traditional Italian pizza made with simple, fresh
      ingredients. It features a classic combination of tomato sauce, fresh
      mozzarella cheese, basil, and olive oil. Named after Queen Margherita of
      Savoy, this pizza represents the colors of the Italian flag with its red
      tomatoes, white cheese, and green basil.

    <h3>Steps to Make Margherita Pizza:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Preheat the Oven:</h4>
        Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) with a pizza stone or baking sheet
        inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Prepare the Pizza Dough:</h4>
        Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
        Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Assemble the Pizza:</h4>
        Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small
        border around the edges. Arrange the fresh mozzarella slices evenly on
        top of the sauce. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Bake the Pizza:</h4>
        Transfer the pizza (with parchment paper) to the preheated pizza stone
        or baking sheet. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden
        and the cheese is bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Add Fresh Basil and Serve:</h4>
        Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately top with fresh basil
        leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. Optionally, sprinkle with grated
        Parmesan cheese. Let the pizza cool for a few minutes before slicing and
        serving.
